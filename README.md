# Golf Grind API 

### What the app does
An instagram style personal blog to post updates on my passion and journey with golf.

Available at: https://golfgrind.onrender.com/
Render is a free web hosting tool, so please be patient as it may take the application a couple minutes to start up if it has not recently been in use! 

### Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- ReactJS
- AWS S3

### Next Steps
There are backend routes already implemented for editing posts, as well as adding and deleting comments. This functionality will be added to the client side soon so that others can engage with posts!

There should be roles implemented as well so that only authenticated users can post to the site, but guests are still able to comment anonymously.
